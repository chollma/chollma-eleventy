<p>I'm a technical product manager based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I have a deep passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible by default.<br>
<br>
I started my career in 2015 as a marketing coordinator for a transportation and gas-price signage company. An insatiable desire to learn and move faster led me to the &quot;agency-life,&quot; helping small and large businesses earn more visibility online.<br>
<br>
Today I work alongside a talented and passionate group of folks at a large specialty outdoor retailer, bringing our vision of inclusive participation and accessibility to life.</p>
