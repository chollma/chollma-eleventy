     <h1>About</h1>
<img class="hero" alt="Cooper and Janessa standing high above a clear blue lake and mountainous landscape" src="/assets/img/about.jpg"/>
<p>I'm a technical product manager based in Tacoma, WA. I have a deep passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible by default.<br>
<br>
A recent transplant to the Pacific Northwest, you can find me, my wife, and our two dogs exploring all that Washington has to offer.
Whether it's a new local restaurant, hiking trail, or ski slope, we're always down for an adventure.<br>
<br>
I started my career in 2015 as a marketing coordinator for a transportation and gas-price signage company. An insatiable desire to learn and move faster led me to the &quot;agency-life,&quot; helping small and large businesses earn more visibility online.<br>
<br>
Today I work alongside a talented and passionate group of folks at a large specialty outdoor retailer, bringing our vision of inclusive participation and accessibility to life.</p>
