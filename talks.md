If you are looking for a contributor, please take note of my speaker rider below. You can reach out about hiring me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CooperHollmaier) or send me an [email](mailto:cooper@hollmaier.com).

## Speaker Rider

I'm honored that you'd like to include me in your event. I believe in creating opportunities that are inclusive and accessible to all.

Before considering me as a contributor, please note the following guidelines below. These are a work-in-progress intended to promote the inclusion of diverse perspectives other than mine as a cisgender white male.

### Hosting

- I ask that travel to and from the event is provided.
- I ask that lodging be provided for the entire length of the event.
- I ask for a ticket to the event. I want to engage with other attendees and see other talks!
- I ask for a speaker fee because I value my time (and hope you do too). Preparing for talks and events takes time away from my other obligations.

### Logistics

- A publically accessible Code of Conduct is required. This document must declare your dedication to creating a safe space, clearly state which behaviors are expected and which are not tolerated, and provide a place for folks to report problems and seek assistance.
- I won't be part of a white-majority, all-men lineup. I want to ensure underrepresented voices are included in the conversation.
- Feel free to record me, but let me know ahead of time and know that I can only represent my personal views and not those of any company.
- It's important to me that everyone has the opportunity to participate in the conversation. This means ensuring closed captioning, text alternatives, and American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation is available.

## Final Thoughts

I appreciate you taking the time to read through these points. I list these out because I want to speak at events that are inclusive, accessible, and represent the diverse perspectives around us. If you have any questions or disagree with any of the information above, please [reach out](/contact/) and provide that feedback.
