<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>his year has put a bright spotlight on the inequities that exist in our world. We've seen inaccessible websites or unjust policing and mountains of cash the 1% have gained while many suffered through a pandemic. While it feels like I'm finally able to breathe a small sigh of relief, as much of country is being vaccinated, I realize that the systemic conditions that led us to this moment persist.

Most of my day-to-day life is spent on the internet. This isn't unusual for people of my generation. We were in middle school and high school when Google, Facebook, and others took the main stage. My first phone was a Motorola Razr flip-phone, not the iPhone 12. We had AOL Instant Messenger, and dial-up internet.

I bring these facts up, not to date myself, but rather to point out that when I was growing up, the internet still had a facade of innocence.

I think it's admirable that Google, Facebook, Apple, and the other big tech companies started out with an altrustic vision. They wanted to make life easier, more connected, more innovative. What pains me now is how these goals have become the wool over our eyes, rather than the reality. We're no longer part of the "reinvestment cycle" that promised to bring a democratized internet and free access. We're now simply the raw materials that make prediction and behavioral modification possible.

I didn't even get 80 pages into this book without feeling a strong urge to abandon the internet and modern life all together. Everything we do, every smart device we own, turns our very existance into digital exhaust that is consumed and refined into "certainty". Friends and family members will say things like, "They already know everything about me" or "I've got nothing to hide".

It's not the data that scares me to a point of existential crisis, but what these companies do with that data. It's the herding and tuning for maximum profit, the threat to my free will that I'm scared of. If we look at the evolution of society through the lense that Shoshana describes, we're headed down a path to lasting numbness. The first modernity as she desribes it is self-sufficient and rich with tradition and storytelling. The second modernity representing a break from these traditions and hard work in favor of a more industrial society. Mass production of the second modernity spread individualistic idea of needing the latest thing in your home and look where that's gotten us. Now we're at the doorstep or rather hanging on my a thread as our very individualism is being forcefully extracted from us.
