<p class="index__intro">Hi, I'm Cooper Hollmaier. I have a passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible</p>
<h2> Current Projects</h2>
<p>I support technical search engine optimization (SEO) at a large specialty outdoor retailer. When I'm not working, you'll find me writing articles, giving talks, tinkering with code, and getting outside.</p>
<h2>Articles</h2>
<p>I often write down my thoughts about remote work, accessibility, SEO, and software engineering. My most recent article was: Moving Towards Accessible-First</p>
<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>I've spoken at a number of events in the past about technical SEO, content marketing, and digital marketing. You can find my latest decks on SpeakerDeck</p>
