<h2> Current Projects</h2>
<p>I currently support the accessibility platform team at a large retailer based in the Pacific Northwest. I also teach a <a href="https://greenlee.iastate.edu/undergraduate/shortcourses/">course</a> at Iowa State University on Search Engine Optimization (SEO). When time allows, I like to share my knowledge and contribute to <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com">The A11y Project</a>. </p>

<p> When I'm not working, you'll find me <a href="/writing">writing</a>, giving <a href="/talks">talks</a>, tinkering with code, and getting outside.</p>
<h2>Articles</h2>
<p>I often write down my thoughts about remote work, accessibility, SEO, and software engineering. My <a href="https://cooperhollmaier.com/post/convincing-business-invest-accessibility/">most recent article</a> was filled with actionable insights you can use to convince your business to invest in accessibility.</p>
<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>I've spoken at several events about technical SEO, digital accessibility, content marketing, and digital marketing. Recently, I had the great pleasure of co-hosting a webinar on <a href="https://accessibility.deque.com/retail-accessibility-strategies-webinar">Accessibility Strategies for Retail Organizations</a> with <a href="https://www.deque.com/">Deque</a></p>
<p>If you'd like to hire me for your event, please check out my <a href="/talks">speaker rider</a> first.</p>
