<p class="index__intro">Hi, I'm Cooper Hollmaier. I have a passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible by default.</p>
<h2> Current Projects</h2>
<p>I support technical search engine optimization (SEO) at a large specialty outdoor retailer. When I'm not working, you'll find me <a href="/writing">writing</a>, giving <a href="/talks">talks</a>, tinkering with code, and getting outside.</p>
<h2>Articles</h2>
<p>I often write down my thoughts about remote work, accessibility, SEO, and software engineering. My <a href="/post/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/">most recent article</a> was commentary on a book I recently read, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff. </p>
<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>I've spoken at a number of events in the past about technical SEO, content marketing, and digital marketing.</p>
<p>If you'd like to hire me for your event, please check out my <a href="/talks">speaker rider</a> first.</p>
