Hi, I'm <h1>Cooper Hollmaier</h1>. I have a passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible for all.
<h2>Current projects</h2>

I support technical search engine optimization (SEO) at a large specialty outdoor retailer. When I'm not working, you'll find me writing articles, giving talks, tinkering with code, and getting outside.

<h2>Writing</h2>

I often write down my thoughts about remote work, accessibility, SEO, and software engineering.

<h2>Talks</h2>

I've spoken at a number of events in the past about technical SEO, content marketing, and digital marketing.
