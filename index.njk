Hi, I'm Cooper Hollmaier. I have a passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible for all.
Current projects

I support technical search engine optimization (SEO) at a large specialty outdoor retailer. When I'm not working, you'll find me writing articles, giving talks, tinkering with code, and getting outside.

Articles

I often write down my thoughts about remote work, accessibility, SEO, and software engineering. My most recent article was: Moving Towards Accessible-First

Talks

I've spoken at a number of events in the past about technical SEO, content marketing, and digital marketing. You can find my latest decks on SpeakerDeck

To hire me for your event, check out my speaker rider.
