            I support technical search engine optimization (SEO) at a large specialty outdoor retailer. When I'm not working, you'll find me writing
            <a href="/writing/">articles</a>, giving <a href="/talks/">talks</a>, tinkering with code and getting outside.
        </p>

            I often write down my thoughts about remote work, accessibility, SEO, and software engineering.
