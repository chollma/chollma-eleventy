# Privacy Statement

I take privacy very seriously and believe you have the right to a secure and transparent experience. I've provided some notes on privacy below.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to send me an email.

## Why are you asking for my email address?

As I publish new articles, code examples, and life updates, I'll send out emails periodically with ConvertKit.

I will not, under any circumstances, share your email or personal information with anyone. Your contact information will only be used to respond to an email you've sent me or send an email update via ConvertKit.

You can opt out of your subscription at any time using the unsubscribe links in every email.

## Final thoughts

The content on this website is pretty straight forward, with a focus on written content. I may decide to use some 3rd-party resources and will include any relevant privacy policies for these services here.
