# About

<img class="hero" alt="Cooper and Janessa standing high above a clear blue lake and mountainous landscape" src="/assets/img/about.jpg"/>

I'm a technical SEO based in Tacoma, WA.
I have a deep passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible by default.
A recent transplant to the Pacific Northwest, you can find me, my wife and our two dogs exploring all that Washington has to offer.
Whether it's a new local restaurant, hiking trail, or ski slope, I'm always down for adventure.\
I started my career in 2015 doing marketing for a transportation and gas-price signage company. An insatiable desire learn and move faster let me to the "agency-life", helping businesses small and large earn more visbility online.\
\
Today I work along-side a talented team of in-house SEOs, at a large eCommerce retailer, bringing techncical SEO strategy to life.
