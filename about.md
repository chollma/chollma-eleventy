# About me

I'm a technical SEO based in Tacoma, WA. My current focus is developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible.

I have an insatiable desire to learn more about myself, people, and the environment that shapes us. Whether it's curling up
on the couch with a book on surveillance capitalism, exploring the trails and peaks of Washington, or competing in a trivia night
over drinks with friends, I'm always itching for the next thing.

Some would describe me as easy-going, others as a perpetual skeptic. I want to try new things, fail hard and make real change a reality.
