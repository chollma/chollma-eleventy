I'm a technical product manager based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I have a deep passion for developing digital products that are fast, sustainable, and accessible by default.\
\
I started my career in 2015 as a marketing coordinator for a transportation and gas-price signage company. An insatiable desire to learn and move faster led me to the "agency-life," helping small and large businesses earn more visibility online.\
\
Today I work alongside a talented and passionate group of folks at a large specialty outdoor retailer, bringing our vision of inclusive participation and accessibility to life.
