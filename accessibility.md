# Accessibility Statement

I'm committed to ensuring that everyone visting CooperHollmaier.com feels welcome and included. I am continually improving the user experience for everyone, and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

## Actions I'm taking

I believe this website should be a positive and accessible place for anyone. Using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 as my north star, I'm making incremental improvements to this frontend experience.

The guidelines outline 3 levels of web accessibility (A, AA, and AAA). My goal is to achieve Level AA compliance with this website.

## How am I doing?

I've only just begun (as of December 2020) and am working to make improvements as time allows. If you have any issues accessing my content, please feel free to send me an email.
